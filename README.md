# Endless-Runenr
This is a simple Endless Runner prototype developed in Unity 6. The project demonstrates essential mechanics such as procedural platform spawning, continuous platform movement, and automated cleanup of game objects. It serves as a foundational template for building more advanced endless runner games by providing clean and modular code for core gameplay functionality.
